- Consider creating demo branches showing completed implementations
- Update GOOD_FIRST_ISSUES.md as issues are completed

## Next Steps

1. Review the templates and adjust as needed
2. Create issues from templates as appropriate
3. Consider implementing 1-2 features yourself as examples
4. Monitor contributor feedback and refine templates
5. Add more templates based on project needs
